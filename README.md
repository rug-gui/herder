  This repo is just like any other Python3 project there is no-thing extravagant going here, you can easily understand the code with a head first dive, if you need documentation it is available [here] . If you've encountered an issue please open up an issue, or are not sure it is a bug, let's talk over at discussions.
  
  ## Support the Project
  I'm currently maintaining this out of my will to build great opensource software, and being a kind of "python expert". Help me keep the project going with your awesome donations, which definitely make my day, after I  often buy myself a coffee out of those. Which eventually generates and kicks off the process of new ideas and features we can bring to this project.
  
  If you're a big corp depending on this project and have some extra talent to provide us in maintaining this one, we'll(whole python community) be pleased.
